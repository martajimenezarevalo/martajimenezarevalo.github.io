         <br> Hello! I’m Maka, an architect trained at ETSAM (Polytechnic University of Madrid), the Technical University of Berlin, and the University of Alicante. 
         <br> I am currently studying the *Master's Program in Media Design at Keio University in Tokyo (Japan),* with the "La Caixa" Foundation Fellowship.
         <br> For the last two years, I have been working at TBA21 — Thyssen Bornemisza Art Contemporary, developing my practice in Collective Learning & Relationships within Organismo | Art in Applied Critical Ecologies, an independent study program developed as an experimental initiative with National Museum Thyssen-Bornemisza. It weaves together research, theory, and speculation through applied case studies to foster regenerative interventions.
         <br> In the past, I have collaborated with diverse design and architecture studios in Berlin, Madrid, Alicante, and Valencia, including CuldeSac, Paisaje Transversal, Soriano & Asociados Arquitectos, and Fundbüro. I’ve also served as an Assistant Professor in Architectural Projects at ETSAM and co-founded multidisciplinary collectives such as o.kroma, Grábalos35, and 100x10. In 2018, with Grábalos35 we performed at the opening of the Spanish Pavilion at the Venice Biennale. 
         <br> I’ve been awarded both the Arquia Foundation Scholarship (2023) and the “la Caixa” Foundation Postgraduate Abroad Fellowship (2024).<br/><br/>
