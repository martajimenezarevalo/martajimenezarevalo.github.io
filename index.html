      <h1>Marta Jiménez Arévalo</h1>
      <p class="bio">
        Hello! I’m Marta Jiménez Arévalo, an architect trained at ETSAM (Polytechnic
        University of Madrid), the Technical University of Berlin, and the University of Alicante. I’ve
        collaborated with diverse design and architecture studios in Berlin, Madrid, Alicante,
        and Valencia, including CuldeSac, Paisaje Transversal, Soriano & Asociados
        Arquitectos, and Fundbüro. I’ve also served as an Assistant Professor in Architectural
        Projects at ETSAM and co-founded multidisciplinary collectives such as o.kroma,
        Grábalos35, and 100x10.<br/><br/>
        My work “Mutant Landscapes,” exploring co-creation between humans and AI, was
        showcased at Madrid’s International Festival of Young Artists and Creators. My research
        project “Ecotono,” focused on landscape digitization, was exhibited at Matadero Madrid
        in 2021. I was also part of the art collective Grábalos35, designing and performing the
        opening of the Spanish Pavilion at the Venice Biennale (2018). I’ve been awarded
        both the Arquia Foundation Scholarship (2023) and the “la Caixa” Foundation
        Postgraduate Abroad Fellowship (2024).<br/><br/>
        Currently, I work at TBA21 — Thyssen Bornemisza Art Contemporary,
        developing my practice in Collective Learning & Relationships within Organismo | Art in
        Applied Critical Ecologies, an independent study program developed as an experimental
        initiative with National Museum Thyssen-Bornemisza. It weaves together research,
        theory, and speculation through applied case studies to foster regenerative interventions.
        My focus is on creative research around climate change and collapse, using fiction and
        virtual reality to speculate on possible futures. My passion lies in exploring emerging
        technologies and their impact on our planet, driven by a belief in the power of art to
        foster real social and cultural transformation.
